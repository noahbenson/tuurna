# Welcome to Tu'urna

Tu'urna is a tabletop role-playing game in the style of Dungeons and Dragons.
These days, players have many rulesets for different kinds of role playing
games to choose from&mdash;for example, [Dungeons and
Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons), [World of
Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Darkness),
[Fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate_(role-playing_game_system)), and
[Daggerheart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daggerheart). In this environment,
Tu'urna distinguishes itself in two ways: first by maximizing the power and
flexibility players have to craft fantastical and extraordinary character
concepts within the game rules; and second by maximizing the power of the
game's narrator to craft rules-based challenges around any narrative event.

Tu'urna additionally seeks to reimagine the cannon of fantasy tropes,
especially western fantasy tropes, in a rich world whose lore can support
virtually any fantasy narrative.
