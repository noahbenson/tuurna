# Game Modes and the Passage of Time

Most of the time during gameplay, {term}`Player`s will be directly narrating
their {term}`Character`'s intentions while the {term}`Narrator` actively
negotiates the ensuing actions and narrates their effects on the world, all
without the temporay structure of explicit rounds or turns. This mode of
running the game, however is just one {term}`Game Mode` called a {term}`Scene`.
In addition to {term}`Scene`s, there are {term}`Game Mode`s called
{term}`Tension` and {term}`Ellipsis`. Several {term}`Scene`s,
{term}`Ellipses<Ellipsis>`, and periods of {term}`Tension` combine together to
form a {term}`Chapter` of the overall narrative of the game.

## Scenes: Unhuried Active Gameplay

{term}`Scene`s are the most common form of gameplay in a typical Tu'urna
campaign. During a {term}`Scene`, there is no turn order or round structure,
and {term}`Players` and the {term}`Narrator` are free to interact as they see
fit. {term}`Scene`s are intended to encompass short amounts of time, usually
ranging from a few minutes to a few hours. The {term}`Narrator` determines when
a {term}`Scene` begins and ends.

Some resources and {term}`Abilities<Ability>` can only be used a certain number
of times per {term}`Scene`; these resources recharge as soon as a new
{term}`Scene` begins.

A few examples of possible {term}`Scene`s follow:
* A short conversation in a bar with an informant.
* A ball at a noble estate that lasts several hours.
* A dinner party.
* A visit to a shop.
* An encounter with wild animals during travel.

## Tension: When Timing is Critical

Sometimes during a {term}`Scene`, events occur such that the precise order and
timing of how things play out becomes critical for understanding how the
{term}`Scene` resolves. One common reason for {term}`Tension` is the advent of
violence (i.e., combat), but any event where timing is critical could call for
{term}`Tension`.

The {term}`Narrator` is in charge of detemining when {term}`Tension` starts and
ends during any {term}`Scene`. {term}`Tension` does not interrupt a
{term}`Scene`; rather, it changes the way the events of the {term}`Scene` are
tracked. {term}`Scene`s do not end when {term}`Tension` starts or ends unless
the {term}`Narrator` determines that the {term}`Scene` has also ended.

A few possible examples of {term}`Tension` follow:
* Someone attacks someone else.
* Someone accuses a {term}`PC` of a crime before a mob.
* A {term}`PC` is attempting to encounter and speak with a spy during a dance
  at a masquerade ball.
* A {term}`PC` realizes they are about to witness an assassination.

The rules of {term}`Tension` are detailed in the [next
chapter](/gameplay/tension).
