# Game Modes and the Passage of Time

Most of the time during gameplay, {term}`Player`s will be directly narrating
their {term}`Character`'s intentions while the {term}`Narrator` actively
negotiates the ensuing actions and narrates their effects on the world, all
without the temporay structure of explicit rounds or turns. This mode of
running the game, however is just one {term}`Game Mode` called a {term}`Scene`.
In addition to {term}`Scene`s, there are {term}`Game Mode`s called
{term}`Tension` and {term}`Ellipsis`. Several {term}`Scene`s,
{term}`Ellipses<Ellipsis>`, and periods of {term}`Tension` combine together to
form a {term}`Chapter` of the overall narrative of the game.


(gameplay:time:scenes)=
## Scenes: Unhuried Active Gameplay

{term}`Scene`s are the most common form of gameplay in a typical Tu'urna
campaign. During a {term}`Scene`, there is no turn order or round structure,
and {term}`Players` and the {term}`Narrator` are free to interact as they see
fit. {term}`Scene`s are intended to encompass short amounts of time, usually
ranging from a few minutes to a few hours. The {term}`Narrator` determines when
a {term}`Scene` begins and ends.

Some resources and {term}`Abilities<Ability>` can only be used a certain number
of times per {term}`Scene`; these resources recharge as soon as a new
{term}`Scene` begins.

A few examples of possible {term}`Scene`s follow:
* A short conversation in a bar with an informant.
* A ball at a noble estate that lasts several hours.
* A dinner party.
* A visit to a shop.
* An encounter with wild animals during travel.


(gameplay:time:tension)=
## Tension: When Timing is Critical

Sometimes during a {term}`Scene`, events occur such that the precise order and
timing of how things play out becomes critical for understanding how the
{term}`Scene` resolves. One common reason for {term}`Tension` is the advent of
violence (i.e., combat), but any event where timing is critical could call for
{term}`Tension`.

The {term}`Narrator` is in charge of detemining when {term}`Tension` starts and
ends during any {term}`Scene`. {term}`Tension` does not interrupt a
{term}`Scene`; rather, it changes the way the events of the {term}`Scene` are
tracked. {term}`Scene`s do not end when {term}`Tension` starts or ends unless
the {term}`Narrator` determines that the {term}`Scene` has also ended.

A few possible examples of {term}`Tension` follow:
* Someone attacks someone else.
* Someone accuses a {term}`PC` of a crime before a mob.
* A {term}`PC` is attempting to encounter and speak with a spy during a dance
  at a masquerade ball.
* A {term}`PC` realizes they are about to witness an assassination.

The rules of {term}`Tension` are detailed in the [next
chapter](/gameplay/tension).


(gameplay:time:ellipsis)=
## Ellipsis: Time Spent Off-Camera

Frequently during a campaign, the {term}`Character`s spend time off-camera
resting, studying, planning, socializing, or any number of other
activities. "Off-camera" in this context simply means that the exact events are
not narrated in a high level of detail and large amounts of time can pass
relatively quickly. These times are called {term}`Ellipses<Ellipsis>`, and they
are determined by the {term}`Narrator`.

Resting and sleeping are the most common reasons for {term}`Ellipsis`, but a
few examples of other reasons for {term}`Ellipsis` follow:
* The {term}`PC`s are undergoing a journey of many hours in a carriage.
* The {term}`PC`s are at a specific location awaiting the arrival of another
  {term}`Character`
* The {term}`PC`s are forced to spend several weeks at an inn during a storm.

(gameplay:time:ellipsis:abilities)=
### Ellipsis Abilities
Only certain {term}`Abilities<Ability>` can be used during {term}`Ellipsis`;
for example, the **Recover** {term}`Ability` of the
[Fitness](skills:core:fitness) {term}`Skill` can be used during
{term}`Ellipsis` to remove or reduce the severity of a {term}`Wound`.
{term}`Abilities<Ability>` that can be used during {term}`Ellipsis` are labeled
as {term}`Ellipsis Abilities<Ellipsis Ability>` in their descriptions.

The [Fitness](skills:core:fitness) {term}`Skill` additionally requires that a
{term}`Character` who uses it spend 1 {term}`Ellipsis Point`.

{term}`Ellipsis Point`s are resources that are granted to {term}`PC`s by the
{term}`Narrator` during {term}`Ellipsis`. The {term}`Narrator` decides how many
{term}`Ellipsis` points the {term}`PC`s receive, usually based on the amount of
time being passed during the {term}`Ellipsis`. The following table provides a
few examples of {term}`Ellipsis Point` budgets for various game scenarios.

```{list-table} Examples of Ellipsis Point Rewards
:header-rows: 1

* - Number of {term}`Ellipsis Point`s
  - Description
* - **1**
  - The {term}`PC`s spend an hour having a meal at a tavern.
* - **2**
  - The {term}`PC`s relax during a carriage ride that lasts a couple of hours.
* - **3**
  - The {term}`PC`s pass an evening in a hideout awaiting a meeting.
* - **4**
  - The {term}`PC`s pass an evening as guests of a noble family at their manor.
* - **5**
  - The {term}`PC`s spend most of a day sightseeing or killing time in a town.
* - **6**
  - The {term}`PC`s rest overnight at an inn.
* - **10**
  - The {term}`PC`s spend a week traveling uneventfully with a caravan.
* - **15**
  - The {term}`PC`s spend multiple weeks awaiting a festival in a city.
```

{term}`Ellipsis Point`s cannot be saved at the end of an {term}`Ellipsis`; any
unspent points are lost.

### What can Ellipsis Points Be Spent On?

{term}`Ellipsis Point`s are used for a variety of purposes, all of which are
enabled by specific {term}`Abilities<Ability>`. For example, the Recover
{term}`Ability` of the [Fitness](skills:core:fitness) {term}`Skill` allows one
to spend an {term}`Ellipsis Point` to remove or reduce the severity of a
{term}`Wound`. (Note that this {term}`Ability` requires a single level of the
[Fitness](skills:core:fitness) {term}`Skill` to use, so it is automatically
accessible to all {term}`Character`s.) All {term}`Abilities<Ability>` that
requires the {term}`Character` to spend an {term}`Ellipsis Point` can be used
during {term}`Ellipsis`.

Typically, {term}`Ellipsis Point`s can be spent the kinds of activities one
would typically perform during "downtime" in a traditional TTRPG. For example
recovering, studying, and working on various projects are all activities that
one can engage in by spending {term}`Ellipsis Point`s. Like the activities that
are performed during {term}`Scene`s, many of the activities that can be
performed during {term}`Ellipsis` require additional materials or circumstances
aside from a period of {term}`Ellipsis`. For example, if a {term}`Character`
wishes to spend part of an {term}`Ellipsis` making or repairing clothing, they
must have a needle and thread. Each {term}`Ability` that can be used during
{term}`Ellipsis` will describe its requirements.
