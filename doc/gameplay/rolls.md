# Rolls

Frequently during gameplay, a {term}`Character` will attempt to do something
whose outcome is not immediately obvious to the {term}`Narrator`. For example,
a {term}`Character` may attempt to leap across a cavern or to pick a lock. The
outcomes of such actions depend on the skills of the {term}`Character`
performing the action. In such cases, the {term}`Narrator` may use one or more
{term}`Roll`s to help adjudicate the outcome.


## The Rules of a Roll

All {term}`Roll`s are made by a {term}`Character` using a {term}`Skill`. When
the {term}`Narrator` calls for a {term}`Roll`, it is up to them to decide what
{term}`Skill` is appropriate. To execute the {term}`Roll`, the {term}`Player`
rolls a number of 6-sided dice equal to their {term}`PC`'s {term}`Level` in the
{term}`Skill`. Each die whose value is 1 or 2 counts as a *loss*. Each die
whose value is 3 or 4 counts as a *win*. Each die whose value is 5 or 6 both
counts as a *win* and causes an additional die to be rolled and treated
identically. The {term}`Roll`'s {term}`Score` is the total number of *win*
values rolled or 9, whichever is lower. If a rule grants a {term}`Character`
{term}`Supernatural Potential` in a {term}`Skill`, then the {term}`Character`
may achieve a {term}`Score` as high as 12 when making a {term}`Roll` instead of
9.

```{note} 

If a {term}`Player` repeatedly rolls 5s or 6s, the dice continue to
be rerolled, and successes continue to accumulate. It is thus theoretically
possible to achieve an arbitrarily high {term}`Score` on any {term}`Roll`, so
long as the {term}`Character`'s {term}`Level` in the {term}`Skill` is greater
than 0.
```

```{note}

It is up to the {term}`Player` to narrate the course of action of their
{term}`PC`, and in so doing they can suggest the use of a particular
{term}`Skill`; for example, if a {term}`Player` chooses to bash a door down,
they can be reasonably confident that the {term}`Narrator` will call for a
{term}`Physique` {term}`Roll` or at least that they won't call for a 
{term}`Reason` {term}`Roll`. It remains up to the {term}`Narrator` to determine
when a {term}`Roll` is required and which {term}`Skill` or {term}`Skills` are
relevant to the circumstances.
```

## What kinds of situations call for rolls?

Broadly speaking, there are two types of situations that require {term}`Roll`s
to adjudicate: {term}`Check`s and {term}`Contest`s.


(gameplay:rolls:checks)=
## Skill Checks

Some narrative situations that arise in gameplay represent attempts to resolve
a static challenge that exist in the world. In such a situation, the outcome
depends only on whether one can apply one's {term}`Skill` in the moment with
sufficient grace to overcome a fixed {term}`Difficulty`. Such
{term}`Check`s are in contrast to contested rolls ({term}`Contest`s) in
which one's skill is set against that of another.

When the {term}`Narrator` feels that an outcome is uncertain, they must decide
on the {term}`Skill` (or {term}`Skill`s) that can resolve the {term}`Check` and
the {term}`Check`'s {term}`Difficulty`. The {term}`Character` or
{term}`Character`s must then execute the {term}`Roll`. The {term}`Narrator`
then compares the character's {term}`Score` against the {term}`Difficulty`

```{list-table} Difficulty Levels
:header-rows: 1
:name: difficulty-levels

* - Difficulty
  - Name
  - Description/Examples
* - 1
  - trivial
  - The challenge can be succeeded by almost anyone: tying a simple knot,
    breaking a twig, reading a sign in a language you understand.
* - 2
  - very easy
  - Minimal skill is required: remembering a word or number, throwing a stone
    10 feet.
* - 3
  - easy
  - Minimal skill is required: remembering a sentence or phrase, jumping over a
    small obstacle.
* - 4
  - mundane
  - Moderate skill is required: overhearing a whispered conversation, picking
    a simple lock, solving an algebra problem.
* - 5
  - moderate
  - Moderate skill is required: knowing specific point of etiquette or history,
    picking a simple lock, solving a difficult algebra problem.
* - 6
  - challenging
  - Substantial skill is required: walking a tightrope, quickly breaking a
    cipher, breaking down a sturdy door.
* - 7
  - difficult
  - The challenge is hard to succeed, even for experts: breaking a difficult
    cipher, cracking a well-built safe, convincing an Outsider to assist you.
* - 8
  - very difficult
  - The greatest mortal practitioners of a skill can succeed at a very
    difficult challenge only slightly more than half of the time: remaining
    unseen in plain daylight, developing new maths, outrunning a tiger.
* - 9
  - nearly impossible
  - The greatest mortal practitioners of a skill can only occasionally succeed
    at neraly impossible challenges: performing a wildly outrageous combat
    maneuver, building an intelligent automaton, magically protecting an entire
    city from disease.
* - 10
  - impossible
  - The task is impossible with mortal means. Even a God would succeed on an
    impossible task only about two out of three times.
```

When a {term}`Check` occurs, the {term}`Narrator` will narrate the challenge
and request that one or more {term}`Character`s make a {term}`Roll` in a
particular {term}`Skill`. Generally speaking, the {term}`Check` is succeeded if
the {term}`Score` of the {term}`Roll` is greater than or equal to the
{term}`Difficulty`, though, in some cases, there may be multiple levels of
success. For example, when trying to remember a point of history, a
{term}`Character` who {term}`Roll`s 6 [Scholarship](skills:mundane:scholarship)
would likely remember more details than a {term}`Character` who {term}`Roll`s 5
but fewer than one who {term}`Roll`s 7.

When a group {term}`Check` is required, the {term}`Narrator` will decide
whether the {term}`Difficulty` must be met by the maximum, the minimum, or the
average value rolled. The maximum value should typically be used when any
{term}`Character`'s success would yield success, such as when trying to spot
something hidden. The minimum value should typically be used when any
{term}`Character`'s failure would yield failure, such as when attempting to
sneak past guards. The average should typically be used when all
{term}`Character`s have equal opportunity to contribute to success, such as
when trying to lift something heavy.


(gameplay:rolls:contests)=
## Contests of Skill

{term}`Contest`s occur when two or more {term}`Character`s act in conflict. In
such a case the {term}`Narrator` must decide which {term}`Skill` each character
is must {term}`Roll` and whether there is {term}`Leverage` inherent in the
contest.  {term}`Leverage` occurs when one {term}`Character` has an advantage
or is using a strategy that is inherently more advantageous in the
{term}`Contest`. For example, if one {term}`Character` were channeling fire at
another {term}`Character` who was countering with an origami shield, the
character using the fire would have substantial {term}`Leverage` due to paper's
inherent weakness to fire. The {term}`Narrator` might award five points of
{term}`Leverage` to the fire sorcerer in such a case.

```{note}

In some cases, the {term}`Narrator` may choose to award {term}`Leverage`
to multiple {term}`Character`s in a {term}`Contest`, for example if each
of the {term}`Character`s employs a different strategy that is nonetheless
effective.
```

```{note}

The {term}`Narrator` may choose to award negative {term}`Leverage` in some
cases to indicate that a strategy is especially poor.
```

Once both {term}`Character`s have {term}`Roll`ed their respective
{term}`Skill`s, the outcome is determined by the sum of each
{term}`Character`'s {term}`Score` and {term}`Leverage`. Typically, the
{term}`Character` with the highest sum wins the {term}`Contest`, but it is up
to the {term}`Narrator` to compares these values and narrates the outcome. If a
tie occurs when a tie is not possible, then the {term}`Contest` is rerolled.


(gameplay:rolls:fate)=
## The Fate of a Roll

Occasionally, a rule may declare, or the {term}`Narrator` may decide, that the
circumstances of a {term}`Roll` are especially favored or unfavored. In such
cases, the formula for accumulating successes, failures, and rerolls is
slightly changed to favor our disfavor the resulting {term}`Score`. The
{term}`Fate`s are described in the following table.

```{list-table} Fates
:header-rows: 1
:name: difficulty-levels

* - Name
  - Description
* - Cursed
  - Dice that show 5 or 6 still count as a success but are no longer rerolled.
* - Unlucky
  - Dice that show 5 still count as a success but are no longer rerolled.
* - Neutral
  - No changes to the rules.
* - Lucky
  - Dice that show 2 count as a success instead of as a failure.
* - Blessed
  - Dice that show 1 or 2 count as a success instead of as a failure.
```

A {term}`Fate` applies to a single {term}`Character`'s roll, so in a
{term}`Contest`, some characters may make {term}`Roll`s with different 
{term}`Fate`s.
