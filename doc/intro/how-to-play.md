# How to Play Tu'urna

Tu'urna is a tabletop role-playing game designed to enable a group of players
to engage in cooperative imaginative storytelling. The rules of Tu'urna are
designed to provide enough of a shared framework to allow the players to
express diverse fantastical characters and stories in a common system.

The first and most important rule of Tu'urna is that it is meant to be fun, and
all other rules are essentially advice about how to achieve that end. The
remaining rules are contained in these documents, but the core rules of
gameplay are as follows:

1. One player must be the {term}`Narrator`. The {term}`Narrator`'s job is to
   interpret and adjudicate the rules and to narrate the environment, the story,
   and the perceptions of the game's {term}`Character`s.
2. The other {term}`Player`s each control at least one {term}`Player
   Character`s ({term}`PC`s). It is each {term}`Player`'s job to narrate the
   desires, thoughts, and intentions of their {term}`PC` and, with the consent of
   the {term}`Narrator`, to directly narrate their {term}`PC`s actions.
3. In all disputes regarding the rules, the {term}`Narrator` is the final
   authority. These rules cannot foresee every possible scenario, and it is the
   {term}`Narrator`'s responsibility to prevent absurd consequences that arise
   from failings in the rules.

## How to Read these Rules

The rules for Tu'urna contained in this document are not intended to be a
watertight description of how every possible game scenario is to be adjudicated
the way that the rules of chess meaningfully cover every possible game
state. Rather, the rules here are meant to describe how typical game scenarios
are adjudicated with the expectation that the {term}`Narrator` will extrapolate
from the examples here. Frequently multiple rules in this document will
conflict; when this happens, the most specific rule, if there is one, should be
considered most authoritative. For example, a rule that applied a bonus to
swords should be considered more authoritative for a sword than a conflicting
rule that applied a different bonus to all weapons because swords are a
specific kind of weapon. When the conflict is not easily resolved, or more
frequently when a scenario arises that the rules fail to anticipate, the
{term}`Narrator` must improvise.

### Glossary
Because of the inherent complexity of these rules, and in order to be as clear
and watertight as possible, these documents employ some organizational
tools. Primarily, any game term that has a specific meaning in the game, such
as {term}`Roll` or {term}`Narrator`, is defined in the [glossary](/glossary)
and is capitalized and linked to its glossary entry whenever that game term is
intended. When a term is not capitalized and linked to its glossary entry, it
should be read using its conventional english meaning. For example,
conventionally the {term}`Narrator` of the game is considered a player, but in
game terms, a {term}`Player` refers specifically to a person who control a
{term}`PC`. It is thus correct to assert that "The {term}`Narrator` is a player
but not a {term}`Player`."

### Tags
Secondly, the rules, especially the rules for {term}`Skill`s employ
{term}`Tag`s, for example the {term}`#fear` {term}`Tag`, which indicates that
an {term}`Effect` is based on the afflicted {term}`Character`'s
fear. {term}`Skill`s, {term}`Effect`s, {term}`Item`s, and {term}`Background`s
can all have tags. These {term}`Tag`s do not imply any rules, but some rules
may apply specifically to the {term}`Skill`s, {term}`Effect`s, {term}`Item`s,
or {term}`Background` that have a particular {term}`Tag`. All {term}`Tag`s are
defined in the [glossary](/glossary) and linked to their glossary entries.
