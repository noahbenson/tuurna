# Core Skills

A character's {term}`Core Skill`s are analogous to game statistics in many
games. In many games, the inherent statistics include such concepts as
strength, intelligence, and dexterity. In Tu'urna, the {term}`Core Skill`s
occupy this space. All characters have the six {term}`Core Skill`s listed
below, and when creating a character, all {term}`Core Skill`s are initially
level 1.


(skills:core:fitness)=
## Fitness

A character's [Fitness](skills:core:fitness) represents the abstract quality of
their physical body and their ability to use their body to accomplish their
goals. A higher [Fitness](skills:core:fitness) is not necessarily associated
with a larger or more muscular body. A {term}`Character` might theoretically
gain [Fitness](skills:core:fitness) due to a magical fortification of their
bones or an improvement in their balance.

    you may spend 1 ellipsis point to remove a single level 1 wound or to

    a wound of level 2 or higher if you do not already have a wound of the
    reduced level.

    shake some of it off. Roll resilience and reduce the damage by the score.
