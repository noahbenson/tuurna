# Inherent Skills

A character's {term}`Inherent Skill`s are analogous to game statistics in many
games. In many games, the inherent statistics include such concepts as
strength, intelligence, and dexterity. In Tu'urna, the {term}`Inherent Skill`s
occupy this space. All characters have the six {term}`Inherent Skill`s listed
below, and when creating a character, all {term}`Inherent Skill`s are initially
level 1.

Resilience represents a character's ability to resist the harms and
manipulations they encounter. A character with high resilience is harder to
damage severely, more likely to resist supernatural influences, and harder to
persuade.

```{list-table} Resilience Skill Levels
:header-rows: 1

* - Level
  - Description
* - 1
  - **Recover**. When you rest, your wounds gradually recover. During ellipsis,
    you may spend 1 ellipsis point to remove a single level 1 wound or to
    reduce a wound of level 2 or higher by one level. This can only be used on
    a wound of level 2 or higher if the character does not already have a wound
    of the reduced level.
* - 2
  - **Toughness**. When you take damage, your natural toughness allows you to
    shake some of it off. Roll resilience and reduce the damage by the score.
* - 3
  - **Lesser Endurance**. At the end of a scene, you may shrug off a level 1
    wound. Once you have used this ability, you may not do so again until the
    next chapter.
* - 4
  - **Health**. When you roll **Toughness** against wasting damage, you may 
    add 1 to the outcome.
